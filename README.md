# Dog-breeds
This project is the second project on Udacity's Deep-Learning Nano-Degree
In this project I trained a CNN model on a set of different dog breed images and I try to predict the breed of a dog when the image of it passed to the model 
If I passed a human picture it should return the most similar breed to this human
